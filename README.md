# Tails on Trails 

Tails on Trails is a website to provide registered users to share information on dog-friendly nature trails in Ireland.

[View the live project here.](https://tailsontrails.herokuapp.com/)

Mock up screenshot will be inserted here.

This site is created as a portfolio project for Code Institute's Software Development course.

## The purpose for this site

This site is created to share/seek the information about dog-friendly nature trails in Ireland.
There are numerous nature trails and their information widely available online however there are not as many information about the suitability of the walk with manâ€™s best friend.
The information on dog-friendly nature trails is not easy to find at present so here I created a forum to share the information and experience of the nature walk with dogs.
This site's use is mainly intended for registered users however unregistered users can view the summary list. The reason for this is to give unregistered user a chance to preview the service before they make a decision whether or not the site is suited for their needs.

## Testing

### Errors encountered during development

* Editing post page not displaying:
  The links to edit post page was added in the forum posts and made only visible for the post author, howoever clicking the link threw 404 error.
  Issue was caused by request user and author not matching, resulting the Http404 raised in the views.py.
  John in Tutor support in Code Institute helped me tackle this issue and suggested few ways to narrow down the cause and approaches to fix it. The successful attempt was to place resuest.user first in the if statement. Here is the problem part of the code, commentd out part shown unsuccessful attempt and final solution which I probably would never have come up by myself.

9. Add Cloudinary Libraries to installed apps in setting.py.
   'cloudinary_storage', before 'django.contrib.staticfiles', and 'cloudinary' after it.

10. Set STATICFILES_DIRS, STATICFILES_DIRS, STATIC_ROOT, MEDIA_URL and DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE in setting.py so that Django can use the directories approproately.
